This is just a quick addition to [the work of Scott Jehl, Paul Irish, Nicholas Zakas](https://github.com/paulirish/matchMedia.js) to work around a [bug with Firefox verions prior to 35 when in an hidden iframe](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1011330), such as when using this in a SalesForce canvas application.

Added NPM support.
